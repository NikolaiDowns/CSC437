# CSC437
True Walk Website

Steps to run locally:
git clone https://github.com/NikolaiDowns/CSC437
cd packages/app
npm run dev
cd ../server
npm start

Go to the website listed after npm run dev, for me, it's http://localhost:5173/

You can also visit https://nadowns.csse.dev/, but the server has been unable to communicate there.
So, if logging in is necessary, please set up the project locally. 

Once the server is setup I suggest using the toolbar on the top to signup.
Once you login you can view your progress at app/track, which can be reached with the "Track Progress" option on the home screen.
After that, I would recommend making a new account, then use the Share Progress and Patient Progress options to share data between two accounts.
